  <aya id="1" text="Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the Book and (of) a Quran that makes (things) clear." />
  <aya id="2" text="Often will those who disbelieve wish that they had been Muslims." />
  <aya id="3" text="Leave them that they may eat and enjoy themselves and (that) hope may beguile them, for they will soon know." />
  <aya id="4" text="And never did We destroy a town but it had a term made known." />
  <aya id="5" text="No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone (it)." />
  <aya id="6" text="And they say: O you to whom the Reminder has been revealed! you are most surely insane:" />
  <aya id="7" text="Why do you not bring to us the angels if you are of the truthful ones?" />
  <aya id="8" text="We do not send the angels but with truth, and then they would not be respited." />
  <aya id="9" text="Surely We have revealed the Reminder and We will most surely be its guardian." />
  <aya id="10" text="And certainly We sent (apostles) before you among the nations of yore." />
  <aya id="11" text="And there never came an apostle to them but they mocked him." />
  <aya id="12" text="Thus do We make it to enter into the hearts of the guilty;" />
  <aya id="13" text="They do not believe in it, and indeed the example of the former people has already passed." />
  <aya id="14" text="And even if We open to them a gateway of heaven, so that they ascend into it all the while," />
  <aya id="15" text="They would certainly say: Only our eyes have been covered over, rather we are an enchanted people." />
  <aya id="16" text="And certainly We have made strongholds in the heaven and We have made it fair seeming to the beholders." />
  <aya id="17" text="And We guard it against every accursed Shaitan," />
  <aya id="18" text="But he who steals a hearing, so there follows him a visible flame." />
  <aya id="19" text="And the earth — We have spread it forth and made in it firm mountains and caused to grow in it of every suitable thing." />
  <aya id="20" text="And We have made in it means of subsistence for you and for him for whom you are not the suppliers." />
  <aya id="21" text="And there is not a thing but with Us are the treasures of it, and We do not send it down but in a known measure." />
  <aya id="22" text="And We send the winds fertilizing, then send down water from the cloud so We give it to you to drink of, nor is it you who store it up." />
  <aya id="23" text="And most surely We bring to life and cause to die and We are the heirs." />
  <aya id="24" text="And certainly We know those of you who have gone before and We certainly know those who shall come later." />
  <aya id="25" text="And surely your Lord will gather them together; surely He is Wise, Knowing." />
  <aya id="26" text="And certainly We created man of clay that gives forth sound, of black mud fashioned in shape." />
  <aya id="27" text="And the jinn We created before, of intensely hot fire." />
  <aya id="28" text="And when your Lord said to the angels: Surely I am going to create a mortal of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape." />
  <aya id="29" text="So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down making obeisance to him." />
  <aya id="30" text="So the angels made obeisance, all of them together," />
  <aya id="31" text="But Iblis (did it not); he refused to be with those who made obeisance." />
  <aya id="32" text="He said: O Iblis! what excuse have you that you are not with those who make obeisance?" />
  <aya id="33" text="He said: I am not such that I should make obeisance to a mortal whom Thou hast created of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape." />
  <aya id="34" text="He said: Then get out of it, for surely you are driven away:" />
  <aya id="35" text="And surely on you is curse until the day of judgment." />
  <aya id="36" text="He said: My Lord! then respite me till the time when they are raised." />
  <aya id="37" text="He said: So surely you are of the respited ones," />
  <aya id="38" text="Till the period of the time made known." />
  <aya id="39" text="He said: My Lord! because Thou hast made life evil to me, I will certainly make (evil) fair-seeming to them on earth, and I will certainly cause them all to deviate," />
  <aya id="40" text="Except Thy servants from among them, the devoted ones." />
  <aya id="41" text="He said: This is a right way with Me:" />
  <aya id="42" text="Surely, as regards My servants, you have no authority over them except those who follow you of the deviators." />
  <aya id="43" text="And surely Hell is the promised place of them all:" />
  <aya id="44" text="It has seven gates; for every gate there shall be a separate party of them." />
  <aya id="45" text="Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in the midst of gardens and fountains:" />
  <aya id="46" text="Enter them in peace, secure." />
  <aya id="47" text="And We will root out whatever of rancor is in their breasts — (they shall be) as brethren, on raised couches, face to face." />
  <aya id="48" text="Toil shall not afflict them in it, nor shall they be ever ejected from it." />
  <aya id="49" text="Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving, the Merciful," />
  <aya id="50" text="And that My punishment — that is the painful punishment." />
  <aya id="51" text="And inform them of the guests of Ibrahim:" />
  <aya id="52" text="When they entered upon him, they said, Peace. He said: Surely we are afraid of you." />
  <aya id="53" text="They said: Be not afraid, surely we give you the good news of a boy, possessing knowledge." />
  <aya id="54" text="He said: Do you give me good news (of a son) when old age has come upon me? — Of what then do you give me good news!" />
  <aya id="55" text="They said: We give you good news with truth, therefore be not of the despairing." />
  <aya id="56" text="He said: And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord but the erring ones?" />
  <aya id="57" text="He said: What is your business then, O messengers?" />
  <aya id="58" text="They said: Surely we are sent towards a guilty people," />
  <aya id="59" text="Except Lut's followers: We will most surely deliver them all," />
  <aya id="60" text="Except his wife; We ordained that she shall surely be of those who remain behind." />
  <aya id="61" text="So when the messengers came to Lut's followers," />
  <aya id="62" text="He said: Surely you are an unknown people." />
  <aya id="63" text="They said: Nay, we have come to you with that about which they disputed." />
  <aya id="64" text="And we have come to you with the truth, and we are most surely truthful." />
  <aya id="65" text="Therefore go forth with your followers in a part of the night and yourself follow their rear, and let not any one of you turn round, and go forth whither you are commanded." />
  <aya id="66" text="And We revealed to him this decree, that the roots of these shall be cut off in the morning." />
  <aya id="67" text="And the people of the town came rejoicing." />
  <aya id="68" text="He said: Surely these are my guests, therefore do not disgrace me," />
  <aya id="69" text="And guard against (the punishment of) Allah and do not put me to shame." />
  <aya id="70" text="They said: Have we not forbidden you from (other) people?" />
  <aya id="71" text="He said: These are my daughters, if you will do (aught)." />
  <aya id="72" text="By your life! they were blindly wandering on in their intoxication." />
  <aya id="73" text="So the rumbling overtook them (while) entering upon the time of sunrise;" />
  <aya id="74" text="Thus did We turn it upside down, and rained down upon them stones of what had been decreed." />
  <aya id="75" text="Surely in this are signs for those who examine." />
  <aya id="76" text="And surely it is on a road that still abides." />
  <aya id="77" text="Most surely there is a sign in this for the believers." />
  <aya id="78" text="And the dwellers of the thicket also were most surely unjust." />
  <aya id="79" text="So We inflicted retribution on them, and they are both, indeed, on an open road (still) pursued." />
  <aya id="80" text="And the dwellers of the Rock certainly rejected the messengers;" />
  <aya id="81" text="And We gave them Our communications, but they turned aside from them;" />
  <aya id="82" text="And they hewed houses in the mountains in security." />
  <aya id="83" text="So the rumbling overtook them in the morning;" />
  <aya id="84" text="And what they earned did not avail them." />
  <aya id="85" text="And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two but in truth; and the hour is most surely coming, so turn away with kindly forgiveness." />
  <aya id="86" text="Surely your Lord is the Creator of all things, the Knowing." />
  <aya id="87" text="And certainly We have given you seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the grand Quran." />
  <aya id="88" text="Do not strain your eyes after what We have given certain classes of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, and make yourself gentle to the believers." />
  <aya id="89" text="And say: Surely I am the plain warner." />
  <aya id="90" text="Like as We sent down on the dividers," />
  <aya id="91" text="Those who made the Quran into shreds." />
  <aya id="92" text="So, by your Lord, We would most certainly question them all," />
  <aya id="93" text="As to what they did." />
  <aya id="94" text="Therefore declare openly what you are bidden and turn aside from the polytheists." />
  <aya id="95" text="Surely We will suffice you against the scoffers," />
  <aya id="96" text="Those who set up another god with Allah; so they shall soon know." />
  <aya id="97" text="And surely We know that your breast straitens at what they say;" />
  <aya id="98" text="Therefore celebrate the praise of your Lord, and be of those who make obeisance." />
  <aya id="99" text="And serve your Lord until there comes to you that which is certain." />
