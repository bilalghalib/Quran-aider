  <aya id="1" text="O you who have wrapped up in your garments!" />
  <aya id="2" text="Rise to pray in the night except a little," />
  <aya id="3" text="Half of it, or lessen it a little," />
  <aya id="4" text="Or add to it, and recite the Quran as it ought to be recited." />
  <aya id="5" text="Surely We will make to light upon you a weighty Word." />
  <aya id="6" text="Surely the rising by night is the firmest way to tread and the best corrective of speech." />
  <aya id="7" text="Surely you have in the day time a long occupation." />
  <aya id="8" text="And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with (exclusive) devotion." />
  <aya id="9" text="The Lord of the East and the West — there is no god but He — therefore take Him for a protector." />
  <aya id="10" text="And bear patiently what they say and avoid them with a becoming avoidance." />
  <aya id="11" text="And leave Me and the rejecters, the possessors of ease and plenty, and respite them a little." />
  <aya id="12" text="Surely with Us are heavy fetters and a flaming fire," />

  <aya id="20" text="Surely your Lord knows that you pass in prayer nearly two-thirds of the night, and (sometimes) half of it, and (sometimes) a third of it, and (also) a party of those with you; and Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are not able to do it, so He has turned to you (mercifully), therefore read what is easy of the Quran. He knows that there must be among you sick, and others who travel in the land seeking of the bounty of Allah, and others who fight in Allah's way, therefore read as much of it as is easy (to you), and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and offer to Allah a goodly gift, and whatever of good you send on beforehand for yourselves, you will find it with Allah; that is best and greatest in reward; and ask forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful." />
