  <aya id="2" text="He said: O my people! Surely I am a plain warner to you:" />
  <aya id="3" text="That you should serve Allah and be careful of (your duty to) Him and obey me:" />
  <aya id="4" text="He will forgive you some of your faults and grant you a delay to an appointed term; surely the term of Allah when it comes is not postponed; did you but know!" />
  <aya id="5" text="He said: O my Lord! surely I have called my people by night and by day!" />
  <aya id="6" text="But my call has only made them flee the more:" />
  <aya id="7" text="And whenever I have called them that Thou mayest forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, cover themselves with their garments, and persist and are puffed up with pride:" />
  <aya id="8" text="Then surely I called to them aloud:" />
  <aya id="9" text="Then surely I spoke to them in public and I spoke to them in secret:" />
  <aya id="10" text="Then I said, Ask forgiveness of your Lord, surely He is the most Forgiving:" />
  <aya id="11" text="He will send down upon you the cloud, pouring down abundance of rain:" />
  <aya id="12" text="And help you with wealth and sons, and make for you gardens, and make for you rivers." />
  <aya id="13" text="What is the matter with you that you fear not the greatness of Allah?" />

  <aya id="15" text="Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens, one above another," />
  <aya id="16" text="And made the moon therein a light, and made the sun a lamp?" />
  <aya id="17" text="And Allah has made you grow out of the earth as a growth:" />
  <aya id="18" text="Then He returns you to it, then will He bring you forth a (new) bringing forth:" />

  <aya id="20" text="That you may go along therein in wide paths." />
  <aya id="21" text="Nuh said: My Lord! surely they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children have added to him nothing but loss." />
