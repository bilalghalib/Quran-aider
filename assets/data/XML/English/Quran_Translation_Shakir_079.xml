  <aya id="1" text="I swear by the angels who violently pull out the souls of the wicked," />
  <aya id="2" text="And by those who gently draw out the souls of the blessed," />
  <aya id="3" text="And by those who float in space," />
  <aya id="4" text="Then those who are foremost going ahead," />
  <aya id="5" text="Then those who regulate the affair." />
  <aya id="6" text="The day on which the quaking one shall quake," />
  <aya id="7" text="What must happen afterwards shall follow it." />
  <aya id="8" text="Hearts on that day shall palpitate," />
  <aya id="9" text="Their eyes cast down." />
  <aya id="10" text="They say: Shall we indeed be restored to (our) first state?" />
  <aya id="11" text="What! when we are rotten bones?" />
  <aya id="12" text="They said: That then would be a return occasioning loss." />
  <aya id="13" text="But it shall be only a single cry," />
  <aya id="14" text="When lo! they shall be wakeful." />
  <aya id="15" text="Has not there come to you the story of Musa?" />
  <aya id="16" text="When his Lord called upon him in the holy valley, twice," />
  <aya id="17" text="Go to Firon, surely he has become inordinate." />
  <aya id="18" text="Then say: Have you (a desire) to purify yourself:" />
  <aya id="19" text="And I will guide you to your Lord so that you should fear." />
  <aya id="20" text="So he showed him the mighty sign." />
  <aya id="21" text="But he rejected (the truth) and disobeyed." />
  <aya id="22" text="Then he went back hastily." />
  <aya id="23" text="Then he gathered (men) and called out." />
  <aya id="24" text="Then he said: I am your lord, the most high." />
  <aya id="25" text="So Allah seized him with the punishment of the hereafter and the former life." />
  <aya id="26" text="Most surely there is in this a lesson to him who fears." />
  <aya id="27" text="Are you the harder to create or the heaven? He made it." />
  <aya id="28" text="He raised high its height, then put it into a right good state." />
  <aya id="29" text="And He made dark its night and brought out its light." />
  <aya id="30" text="And the earth, He expanded it after that." />
  <aya id="31" text="He brought forth from it its water and its pasturage." />
  <aya id="32" text="And the mountains, He made them firm," />
  <aya id="33" text="A provision for you and for your cattle." />
  <aya id="34" text="But when the great predominating calamity comes;" />
  <aya id="35" text="The day on which man shall recollect what he strove after," />
  <aya id="36" text="And the hell shall be made manifest to him who sees" />
  <aya id="37" text="Then as for him who is inordinate," />
  <aya id="38" text="And prefers the life of this world," />
  <aya id="39" text="Then surely the hell, that is the abode." />
  <aya id="40" text="And as for him who fears to stand in the presence of his Lord and forbids the soul from low desires," />
  <aya id="41" text="Then surely the garden — that is the abode." />
  <aya id="42" text="They ask you about the hour, when it will come." />
  <aya id="43" text="About what! You are one to remind of it." />
  <aya id="44" text="To your Lord is the goal of it." />
  <aya id="45" text="You are only a warner to him who would fear it." />
  <aya id="46" text="On the day that they see it, it will be as though they had not tarried but the latter part of a day or the early part of it." />
