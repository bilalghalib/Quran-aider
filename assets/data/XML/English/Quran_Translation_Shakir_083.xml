  <aya id="1" text="Woe to the defrauders," />
  <aya id="2" text="Who, when they take the measure (of their dues) from men take it fully," />
  <aya id="3" text="But when they measure out to others or weigh out for them, they are deficient." />
  <aya id="4" text="Do not these think that they shall be raised again," />
  <aya id="5" text="For a mighty day," />
  <aya id="6" text="The day on which men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds?" />
  <aya id="7" text="Nay! most surely the record of the wicked is in the Sijjin." />
  <aya id="8" text="And what will make you know what the Sijjin is?" />
  <aya id="9" text="It is a written book." />
  <aya id="10" text="Woe on that day to the rejecters," />
  <aya id="11" text="Who give the lie to the day of judgment." />
  <aya id="12" text="And none gives the lie to it but every exceeder of limits, sinful one;" />
  <aya id="13" text="When Our communications are recited to him, he says: Stories of those of yore." />
  <aya id="14" text="Nay! rather, what they used to do has become like rust . upon their hearts." />
  <aya id="15" text="Nay! most surely they shall on that day be debarred from their Lord." />
  <aya id="16" text="Then most surely they shall enter the burning fire." />
  <aya id="17" text="Then shall it be said: This is what you gave the lie to." />
  <aya id="18" text="Nay! Most surely the record of the righteous shall be in the Iliyin." />
  <aya id="19" text="And what will make you know what the highest Iliyin is?" />
  <aya id="20" text="It is a written book," />
  <aya id="21" text="Those who are drawn near (to Allah) shall witness it." />
  <aya id="22" text="Most surely the righteous shall be in bliss," />
  <aya id="23" text="On thrones, they shall gaze;" />
  <aya id="24" text="You will recognize in their faces the brightness of bliss." />
  <aya id="25" text="They are made to quaff of a pure drink that is sealed (to others)." />
  <aya id="26" text="The sealing of it is (with) musk; and for that let the aspirers aspire." />
  <aya id="27" text="And the admixture of it is a water of Tasnim," />
  <aya id="28" text="A fountain from which drink they who are drawn near (to Allah)." />
  <aya id="29" text="Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who believe." />
  <aya id="30" text="And when they passed by them, they winked at one another." />
  <aya id="31" text="And when they returned to their own followers they returned exulting." />
  <aya id="32" text="And when they saw them, they said: Most surely these are in error;" />
  <aya id="33" text="And they were not sent to be keepers over them." />
