  <aya id="1" text="Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He has power over all things," />
  <aya id="2" text="Who created death and life that He may try you — which of you is best in deeds; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving," />
  <aya id="3" text="Who created the seven heavens one above another; you see no incongruity in the creation of the Beneficent God; then look again, can you see any disorder?" />
  <aya id="4" text="Then turn back the eye again and again; your look shall come back to you confused while it is fatigued." />
  <aya id="5" text="And certainly We have adorned this lower heaven with ( lamps and We have made these missiles for the Shaitans, and We have prepared for them the chastisement of burning." />
  <aya id="6" text="And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of hell, and evil is the resort." />
  <aya id="7" text="When they shall be cast therein, they shall hear a loud moaning of it as it heaves," />
  <aya id="8" text="Almost bursting for fury. Whenever a group is cast into it, its keeper shall ask them: Did there not come to you a warner?" />
  <aya id="9" text="They shall say: Yea! indeed there came to us a warner, but we rejected (him) and said: Allah has not revealed anything, you are only in a great error." />
  <aya id="10" text="And they shall say: Had we but listened or pondered, we should not have been among the inmates of the burning fire." />
  <aya id="11" text="So they shall acknowledge their sins, but far will be (forgiveness) from the inmates of the burning fire." />
  <aya id="12" text="(As for) those who fear their Lord in secret, they shall surely have forgiveness and a great reward." />
  <aya id="13" text="And conceal your word or manifest it; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the hearts." />
  <aya id="14" text="Does He not know, Who created? And He is the Knower of the subtleties, the Aware." />
  <aya id="15" text="He it is Who made the earth smooth for you, therefore go about in the spacious sides thereof, and eat of His sustenance, and to Him is the return after death." />
  <aya id="16" text="Are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not make the earth to swallow you up? Then lo! it shall be in a state of commotion." />
  <aya id="17" text="Or are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not send down upon you a punishment? Then shall you know how was My warning." />
  <aya id="18" text="And certainly those before them rejected (the truth), then how was My disapproval." />
  <aya id="19" text="Have they not seen the birds above them expanding (their wings) and contracting (them)? What is it that withholds them save the Beneficent God? Surely He sees everything." />
  <aya id="20" text="Or who is it that will be a host for you to assist you besides the Beneficent God? The unbelievers are only in deception." />
  <aya id="21" text="Or who is it that will give you sustenance if He should withhold His sustenance? Nay! they persist in disdain and aversion." />
  <aya id="22" text="What! is he who goes prone upon his face better guided or he who walks upright upon a straight path?" />
  <aya id="23" text="Say: He it is Who brought you into being and made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts: little is it that you give thanks." />
  <aya id="24" text="Say: He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you shall be gathered." />
  <aya id="25" text="And they say: When shall this threat be (executed) if you are truthful?" />
  <aya id="26" text="Say: The knowledge (thereof) is only with Allah and I am only a plain warner." />
  <aya id="27" text="But when they shall see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve shall be sorry, and it shall be said; This is that which you used to call for." />
  <aya id="28" text="Say: Have you considered if Allah should destroy me and those with me — rather He will have mercy on us; yet who will protect the unbelievers from a painful punishment?" />
  <aya id="29" text="Say: He is the Beneficent God, we believe in Him and on Him do we rely, so you shall come to know who it is that is in clear error." />
  <aya id="30" text="Say: Have you considered if your water should go down, who is it then that will bring you flowing water?" />
