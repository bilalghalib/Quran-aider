  <aya id="2" text="These are the verses of the Book that makes (things) clear." />
  <aya id="3" text="Perhaps you will kill yourself with grief because they do not believe." />
  <aya id="4" text="If We please, We should send down upon them a sign from the heaven so that their necks should stoop to it." />
  <aya id="5" text="And there does not come to them a new reminder from the Beneficent God but they turn aside from it." />
  <aya id="6" text="So they have indeed rejected (the truth), therefore the news of that which they mock shall soon come to them." />
  <aya id="7" text="Do they not see the earth, how many of every noble kind We have caused to grow in it?" />
  <aya id="8" text="Most surely there is a sign in that, but most of them will not believe." />
  <aya id="9" text="And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful." />
  <aya id="10" text="And when your Lord called out to Musa, saying: Go to the unjust people," />
  <aya id="11" text="The people of Firon: Will they not guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="12" text="He said: O my Lord! surely I fear that they will reject me;" />
  <aya id="13" text="And by breast straitens, and my tongue is not eloquent, therefore send Thou to Haroun (to help me);" />
  <aya id="14" text="And they have a crime against me, therefore I fear that they may slay me." />
  <aya id="15" text="He said: By no means, so go you both with Our signs; surely We are with you, hearing;" />
  <aya id="16" text="Then come to Firon and say: Surely we are the messengers of the Lord of the worlds:" />
  <aya id="17" text="Then send with us the children of Israel." />
  <aya id="18" text="(Firon) said: Did we not bring you up as a child among us, and you tarried among us for (many) years of your life?" />
  <aya id="19" text="And you did (that) deed of yours which you did, and you are one of the ungrateful." />
  <aya id="20" text="He said: I did it then while I was of those unable to see the right course;" />
  <aya id="21" text="So I fled from you when I feared you, then my Lord granted me wisdom and made me of the apostles;" />
  <aya id="22" text="And is it a favor of which you remind me that you have enslaved the children of Israel?" />
  <aya id="23" text="Firon said: And what is the Lord of the worlds?" />
  <aya id="24" text="He said: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you would be sure." />
  <aya id="25" text="(Firon) said to those around him: Do you not hear?" />
  <aya id="26" text="He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old." />
  <aya id="27" text="Said he: Most surely your Apostle who is sent to you is mad." />
  <aya id="28" text="He said: The Lord of the east and the west and what is between them, if you understand." />
  <aya id="29" text="Said he: If you will take a god besides me, I will most certainly make you one of the imprisoned." />
  <aya id="30" text="He said: What! even if I bring to you something manifest?" />
  <aya id="31" text="Said he: Bring it then, if you are of the truthful ones." />
  <aya id="32" text="So he cast down his rod, and lo! it was an obvious serpent," />
  <aya id="33" text="And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it appeared white to the onlookers." />
  <aya id="34" text="(Firon) said to the chiefs around him: Most surely this is a skillful magician," />
  <aya id="35" text="Who desires to turn you out of your land with his magic; what is it then that you advise?" />
  <aya id="36" text="They said: Give him and his brother respite and send heralds into the cities;" />
  <aya id="37" text="That they should bring to you every skillful magician." />
  <aya id="38" text="So the magicians were gathered together at the appointed time on the fixed day," />
  <aya id="39" text="And it was said to the people: Will you gather together?" />
  <aya id="40" text="Haply we may follow the magicians, if they are the vanquishers." />
  <aya id="41" text="And when the magicians came, they said to Firon: Shall we get a reward if we are the vanquishers?" />
  <aya id="42" text="He said: Yes, and surely you will then be of those who are made near." />
  <aya id="43" text="Musa said to them: Cast what you are going to cast." />
  <aya id="44" text="So they cast down their cords and their rods and said: By Firon's power, we shall most surely be victorious." />
  <aya id="45" text="Then Musa cast down his staff and lo! it swallowed up the lies they told." />
  <aya id="46" text="And the magicians were thrown down prostrate;" />
  <aya id="47" text="They said: We believe in the Lord of the worlds:" />
  <aya id="48" text="The Lord of Musa and Haroun." />
  <aya id="49" text="Said he: You believe in him before I give you permission; most surely he is the chief of you who taught you the magic, so you shall know: certainly I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and certainly I will crucify you all." />
  <aya id="50" text="They said: No harm; surely to our Lord we go back;" />
  <aya id="51" text="Surely we hope that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first of the believers." />
  <aya id="52" text="And We revealed to Musa, saying: Go away with My servants travelling by night, surely you will be pursued." />
  <aya id="53" text="So Firon sent heralds into the cities;" />
  <aya id="54" text="Most surely these are a small company;" />
  <aya id="55" text="And most surely they have enraged us;" />
  <aya id="56" text="And most surely we are a vigilant multitude." />
  <aya id="57" text="So We turned them out of gardens and springs," />
  <aya id="58" text="And treasures and goodly dwellings," />
  <aya id="59" text="Even so. And We gave them as a heritage to the children of Israel." />
  <aya id="60" text="Then they pursued them at sunrise." />
  <aya id="61" text="So when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa cried out: Most surely we are being overtaken." />
  <aya id="62" text="He said: By no means; surely my Lord is with me: He will show me a way out." />
  <aya id="63" text="Then We revealed to Musa: Strike the sea with your staff. So it had cloven asunder, and each part was like a huge mound." />
  <aya id="64" text="And We brought near, there, the others." />
  <aya id="65" text="And We saved Musa and those with him, all of them." />
  <aya id="66" text="Then We drowned the others." />
  <aya id="67" text="Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe." />
  <aya id="68" text="And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful." />
  <aya id="69" text="And recite to them the story of Ibrahim." />
  <aya id="70" text="When he said to his father and his people: What do you worship?" />
  <aya id="71" text="They said: We worship idols, so we shall be their votaries." />
  <aya id="72" text="He said: Do they hear you when you call?" />
  <aya id="73" text="Or do they profit you or cause you harm?" />
  <aya id="74" text="They said: Nay, we found our fathers doing so." />
  <aya id="75" text="He said: Have you then considered what you have been worshipping:" />
  <aya id="76" text="You and your ancient sires." />
  <aya id="77" text="Surely they are enemies to me, but not (so) the Lord of the worlds;" />
  <aya id="78" text="Who created me, then He has shown me the way:" />
  <aya id="79" text="And He Who gives me to eat and gives me to drink:" />
  <aya id="80" text="And when I am sick, then He restores me to health;" />
  <aya id="81" text="And He Who will cause me to die, then give me life;" />
  <aya id="82" text="And Who, I hope, will forgive me my mistakes on the day of judgment." />
  <aya id="83" text="My Lord: Grant me wisdom, and join me with the good;" />
  <aya id="84" text="And ordain for me a goodly mention among posterity;" />
  <aya id="85" text="And make me of the heirs of the garden of bliss;" />
  <aya id="86" text="And forgive my father, for surely he is of those who have gone astray;" />
  <aya id="87" text="And disgrace me not on the day when they are raised," />
  <aya id="88" text="The day on which property will not avail, nor sons," />
  <aya id="89" text="Except him who comes to Allah with a heart free (from evil)." />
  <aya id="90" text="And the garden shall be brought near for those who guard (against evil)," />
  <aya id="91" text="And the hell shall be made manifest to the erring ones," />
  <aya id="92" text="And it shall be said to them: Where are those that you used to worship;" />
  <aya id="93" text="Besides Allah? Can they help you or yet help themselves?" />
  <aya id="94" text="So they shall be thrown down into it, they and the erring ones," />
  <aya id="95" text="And the hosts of the Shaitan, all." />
  <aya id="96" text="They shall say while they contend therein:" />
  <aya id="97" text="By Allah! we were certainly in manifest error," />
  <aya id="98" text="When we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds;" />
  <aya id="99" text="And none but the guilty led us astray;" />
  <aya id="100" text="So we have no intercessors," />
  <aya id="101" text="Nor a true friend;" />
  <aya id="102" text="But if we could but once return, we would be of the believers." />
  <aya id="103" text="Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe." />
  <aya id="104" text="And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful." />
  <aya id="105" text="The people of Nuh rejected the apostles." />
  <aya id="106" text="When their brother Nuh said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="107" text="Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;" />
  <aya id="108" text="Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me;" />
  <aya id="109" text="And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds:" />
  <aya id="110" text="So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me." />
  <aya id="111" text="They said: Shall we believe in you while the meanest follow you?" />
  <aya id="112" text="He said: And what knowledge have I of what they do?" />
  <aya id="113" text="Their account is only with my Lord, if you could perceive" />
  <aya id="114" text="And I am not going to drive away the believers;" />
  <aya id="115" text="I am naught but a plain warner." />
  <aya id="116" text="They said: If you desist not, O Nuh, you shall most certainly be of those stoned to death." />
  <aya id="117" text="He said: My Lord! Surely my people give me the lie!" />
  <aya id="118" text="Therefore judge Thou between me and them with a (just) judgment, and deliver me and those who are with me of the believers." />
  <aya id="119" text="So We delivered him and those with him in the laden ark." />
  <aya id="120" text="Then We drowned the rest afterwards" />
  <aya id="121" text="Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe." />
  <aya id="122" text="And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful." />
  <aya id="123" text="Ad gave the lie to the apostles." />
  <aya id="124" text="When their brother Hud said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="125" text="Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;" />
  <aya id="126" text="Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:" />
  <aya id="127" text="And I do not ask you any reward for it; surely my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds;" />
  <aya id="128" text="Do you build on every height a monument? Vain is it that you do:" />
  <aya id="129" text="And you make strong fortresses that perhaps you may" />
  <aya id="130" text="And when you lay hands (on men) you lay hands (like) tyrants;" />
  <aya id="131" text="So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me" />
  <aya id="132" text="And be careful of (your duty to) Him Who has given you abundance of what you know." />
  <aya id="133" text="He has given you abundance of cattle and children," />
  <aya id="134" text="And gardens and fountains;" />
  <aya id="135" text="Surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day." />
  <aya id="136" text="They said: It is the same to us whether you admonish or are not one of the admonishers;" />
  <aya id="137" text="This is naught but a custom of the ancients;" />
  <aya id="138" text="And we are not going to be punished." />
  <aya id="139" text="So they gave him the lie, then We destroyed them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe." />
  <aya id="140" text="And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful." />
  <aya id="141" text="Samood gave the lie to the apostles." />
  <aya id="142" text="When their brother Salih said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="143" text="Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;" />
  <aya id="144" text="Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:" />
  <aya id="145" text="And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds:" />
  <aya id="146" text="Will you be left secure in what is here;" />
  <aya id="147" text="In gardens and fountains," />
  <aya id="148" text="And cornfields and palm-trees having fine spadices?" />
  <aya id="149" text="And you hew houses out of the mountains exultingly;" />
  <aya id="150" text="Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me;" />
  <aya id="151" text="And do not obey the bidding of the extravagant," />
  <aya id="152" text="Who make mischief in the land and do not act aright." />
  <aya id="153" text="They said: You are only of the deluded ones;" />
  <aya id="154" text="You are naught but a mortal like ourselves; so bring a sign if you are one of the truthful." />
  <aya id="155" text="He said: This is a she-camel; she shall have her portion of water, and you have your portion of water on an appointed time;" />
  <aya id="156" text="And do not touch her with evil, lest the punishment of a grievous day should overtake you." />
  <aya id="157" text="But they hamstrung her, then regretted;" />
  <aya id="158" text="So the punishment overtook them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe." />
  <aya id="159" text="And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful." />
  <aya id="160" text="The people of Lut gave the lie to the apostles." />
  <aya id="161" text="When their brother Lut said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="162" text="Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;" />
  <aya id="163" text="Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:" />
  <aya id="164" text="And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds;" />
  <aya id="165" text="What! do you come to the males from among the creatures," />
  <aya id="166" text="And leave what your Lord has created for you of your wives? Nay, you are a people exceeding limits." />
  <aya id="167" text="They said: If you desist not, O Lut! you shall surely be of those who are expelled." />
  <aya id="168" text="He said: Surely I am of those who utterly abhor your doing;" />
  <aya id="169" text="My Lord! deliver me and my followers from what they do." />
  <aya id="170" text="So We delivered him and his followers all," />
  <aya id="171" text="Except an old woman, among those who remained behind." />
  <aya id="172" text="Then We utterly destroyed the others." />
  <aya id="173" text="And We rained down upon them a rain, and evil was the rain on those warned." />
  <aya id="174" text="Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe." />
  <aya id="175" text="And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful." />
  <aya id="176" text="The dwellers of the thicket gave the lie to the apostles." />
  <aya id="177" text="When Shu'aib said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="178" text="Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;" />
  <aya id="179" text="Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:" />
  <aya id="180" text="And I do not ask you any reward for it, my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds;" />
  <aya id="181" text="Give a full measure and be not of those who diminish;" />
  <aya id="182" text="And weigh (things) with a right balance," />
  <aya id="183" text="And do not wrong men of their things, and do not act corruptly in the earth, making mischief." />
  <aya id="184" text="And guard against (the punishment of) Him who created you and the former nations." />
  <aya id="185" text="They said: You are only of those deluded;" />
  <aya id="186" text="And you are naught but a mortal like ourselves, and we know you to be certainly of the liars." />
  <aya id="187" text="Therefore cause a portion of the heaven to come down upon us, if you are one of the truthful." />
  <aya id="188" text="He said: My Lord knows best what you do." />
  <aya id="189" text="But they called him a liar, so the punishment of the day of covering overtook them; surely it was the punishment of a grievous day." />
  <aya id="190" text="Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe." />
  <aya id="191" text="And most surely your Lord is Mighty, the Merciful." />
  <aya id="192" text="And most surely this is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds." />
  <aya id="193" text="The Faithful Spirit has descended with it," />
  <aya id="194" text="Upon your heart that you may be of the warners," />
  <aya id="195" text="In plain Arabic language." />
  <aya id="196" text="And most surely the same is in the scriptures of the ancients." />
  <aya id="197" text="Is it not a sign to them that the learned men of the Israelites know it?" />
  <aya id="198" text="And if we had revealed it to any of the foreigners," />
  <aya id="199" text="So that he should have recited it to them, they would not have believed therein." />
  <aya id="200" text="Thus have We caused it to enter into the hearts of the guilty." />
  <aya id="201" text="They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment." />
  <aya id="202" text="And it shall come to them all of a sudden, while they shall not perceive;" />
  <aya id="203" text="Then they will say: Shall we be respited?" />
  <aya id="204" text="What! do they still seek to hasten on Our punishment?" />
  <aya id="205" text="Have you then considered if We let them enjoy themselves for years," />
  <aya id="206" text="Then there comes to them that with which they are threatened," />
  <aya id="207" text="That which they were made to enjoy shall not avail them?" />
  <aya id="208" text="And We did not destroy any town but it had (its) warners," />
  <aya id="209" text="To remind, and We are never unjust." />
  <aya id="210" text="And the Shaitans have not come down with it." />
  <aya id="211" text="And it behooves them not, and they have not the power to do (it)." />
  <aya id="212" text="Most surely they are far removed from the hearing of it." />
  <aya id="213" text="So call not upon another god with Allah, lest you be of those who are punished." />
  <aya id="214" text="And warn your nearest relations," />
  <aya id="215" text="And be kind to him who follows you of the believers." />
  <aya id="216" text="But if they disobey you, then say: Surely I am clear of what you do." />
  <aya id="217" text="And rely on the Mighty, the Merciful," />
  <aya id="218" text="Who sees you when you stand up." />
  <aya id="219" text="And your turning over and over among those who prostrate themselves before Allah." />
  <aya id="220" text="Surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing." />
  <aya id="221" text="Shall I inform you (of him) upon whom the Shaitans descend?" />
  <aya id="222" text="They descend upon every lying, sinful one," />
  <aya id="223" text="They incline their ears, and most of them are liars." />
  <aya id="224" text="And as to the poets, those who go astray follow them." />
  <aya id="225" text="Do you not see that they wander about bewildered in every valley?" />
  <aya id="226" text="And that they say that which they do not do," />
  <aya id="227" text="Except those who believe and do good and remember Allah much, and defend themselves after they are oppressed; and they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back." />
