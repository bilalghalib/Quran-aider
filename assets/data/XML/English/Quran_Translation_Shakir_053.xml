  <aya id="1" text="I swear by the star when it goes down." />
  <aya id="2" text="Your companion does not err, nor does he go astray;" />
  <aya id="3" text="Nor does he speak out of desire." />
  <aya id="4" text="It is naught but revelation that is revealed," />
  <aya id="5" text="The Lord of Mighty Power has taught him," />
  <aya id="6" text="The Lord of Strength; so he attained completion," />
  <aya id="7" text="And he is in the highest part of the horizon." />
  <aya id="8" text="Then he drew near, then he bowed," />
  <aya id="9" text="So he was the measure of two bows or closer still." />
  <aya id="10" text="And He revealed to His servant what He revealed." />
  <aya id="11" text="The heart was not untrue in (making him see) what he saw." />
  <aya id="12" text="What! do you then dispute with him as to what he saw?" />
  <aya id="13" text="And certainly he saw him in another descent," />
  <aya id="14" text="At the farthest lote-tree;" />
  <aya id="15" text="Near which is the garden, the place to be resorted to." />
  <aya id="16" text="When that which covers covered the lote-tree;" />
  <aya id="17" text="The eye did not turn aside, nor did it exceed the limit." />
  <aya id="18" text="Certainly he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord." />
  <aya id="19" text="Have you then considered the Lat and the Uzza," />
  <aya id="20" text="And Manat, the third, the last?" />
  <aya id="21" text="What! for you the males and for Him the females!" />
  <aya id="22" text="This indeed is an unjust division!" />
  <aya id="23" text="They are naught but names which you have named, you and your fathers; Allah has not sent for them any authority. They follow naught but conjecture and the low desires which (their) souls incline to; and certainly the guidance has come to them from their Lord." />
  <aya id="24" text="Or shall man have what he wishes?" />
  <aya id="25" text="Nay! for Allah is the hereafter and the former (life)." />
  <aya id="26" text="And how many an angel is there in the heavens whose intercession does not avail at all except after Allah has given permission to whom He pleases and chooses." />
  <aya id="27" text="Most surely they who do not believe in the hereafter name the angels with female names." />
  <aya id="28" text="And they have no knowledge of it; they do not follow anything but conjecture, and surely conjecture does not avail against the truth at all." />
  <aya id="29" text="Therefore turn aside from him who turns his back upon Our reminder and does not desire anything but this world's life." />
  <aya id="30" text="That is their goal of knowledge; surely your Lord knows best him who goes astray from His path and He knows best him who follows the right direction." />
  <aya id="31" text="And Allah's is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and (that) He may reward those who do good with goodness." />
  <aya id="32" text="Those who keep aloof from the great sins and the indecencies but the passing idea; surely your Lord is liberal in forgiving. He knows you best when He brings you forth from the earth and when you are embryos in the wombs of your mothers; therefore do not attribute purity to your souls; He knows him best who guards (against evil)." />
  <aya id="33" text="Have you then seen him who turns his back?" />
  <aya id="34" text="And gives a little and (then) withholds." />
  <aya id="35" text="Has he the knowledge of the unseen so that he can see?" />
  <aya id="36" text="Or, has he not been informed of what is in the scriptures of Musa?" />
  <aya id="37" text="And (of) Ibrahim who fulfilled (the commandments):" />
  <aya id="38" text="That no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another-" />
  <aya id="39" text="And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for-" />
  <aya id="40" text="And that his striving shall soon be seen-" />
  <aya id="41" text="Then shall he be rewarded for it with the fullest reward-" />
  <aya id="42" text="And that to your Lord is the goal-" />
  <aya id="43" text="And that He it is Who makes (men) laugh and makes (them) weep;" />
  <aya id="44" text="And that He it is Who causes death and gives life-" />
  <aya id="45" text="And that He created pairs, the male and the female," />
  <aya id="46" text="From the small seed when it is adapted;" />
  <aya id="47" text="And that on Him is the bringing forth a second time;" />
  <aya id="48" text="And that He it is Who enriches and gives to hold;" />
  <aya id="49" text="And that He is the Lord of the Sirius;" />
  <aya id="50" text="And that He did destroy the Ad of old," />
  <aya id="51" text="And Samood, so He spared not," />
  <aya id="52" text="And the people of Nuh before; surely they were most unjust and inordinate;" />
  <aya id="53" text="And the overthrown cities did He overthrow," />
  <aya id="54" text="So there covered them that which covered." />
  <aya id="55" text="Which of your Lord's benefits will you then dispute about?" />
  <aya id="56" text="This is a warner of the warners of old." />
  <aya id="57" text="The near event draws nigh." />
  <aya id="58" text="There shall be none besides Allah to remove it." />
  <aya id="59" text="Do you then wonder at this announcement?" />
  <aya id="60" text="And will you laugh and not weep?" />
  <aya id="61" text="While you are indulging in varieties." />
  <aya id="62" text="So make obeisance to Allah and serve (Him)." />
