  <aya id="1" text="Ya Seen." />
  <aya id="2" text="I swear by the Quran full of wisdom;" />
  <aya id="3" text="Most surely you are one of the apostles," />
  <aya id="4" text="On a right way." />
  <aya id="5" text="A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful." />
  <aya id="6" text="That you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned, so they are heedless." />
  <aya id="7" text="Certainly the word has proved true of most of them, so they do not believe." />
  <aya id="8" text="Surely We have placed chains on their necks, and these reach up to their chins, so they have their heads raised aloft." />
  <aya id="9" text="And We have made before them a barrier and a barrier behind them, then We have covered them over so that they do not see." />
  <aya id="10" text="And it is alike to them whether you warn them or warn them not: they do not believe." />
  <aya id="11" text="You can only warn him who follows the reminder and fears the Beneficent God in secret; so announce to him forgiveness and an honorable reward." />
  <aya id="12" text="Surely We give life to the dead, and We write down what they have sent before and their footprints, and We have recorded everything in a clear writing." />
  <aya id="13" text="And set out to them an example of the people of the town, when the messengers came to it." />
  <aya id="14" text="When We sent to them two, they rejected both of them, then We strengthened (them) with a third, so they said: Surely we are messengers to you." />
  <aya id="15" text="They said: You are naught but mortals like ourselves, nor has the Beneficent God revealed anything; you only lie." />
  <aya id="16" text="They said: Our Lord knows that we are most surely messengers to you." />
  <aya id="17" text="And nothing devolves on us but a clear deliverance (of the message)." />
  <aya id="18" text="They said: Surely we augur evil from you; if you do not desist, we will certainly stone you, and there shall certainly afflict you a painful chastisement from us." />
  <aya id="19" text="They said: Your evil fortune is with you; what! if you are reminded! Nay, you are an extravagant people." />
  <aya id="20" text="And from the remote part of the city there came a man running, he said: O my people! follow the messengers;" />
  <aya id="21" text="Follow him who does not ask you for reward, and they are the followers of the right course;" />
  <aya id="22" text="And what reason have I that I should not serve Him Who brought me into existence? And to Him you shall be brought back;" />
  <aya id="23" text="What! shall I take besides Him gods whose intercession, If the Beneficent God should desire to afflict me with a harm, shall not avail me aught, nor shall they be able to deliver me?" />
  <aya id="24" text="In that case I shall most surely be in clear error:" />
  <aya id="25" text="Surely I believe in your Lord, therefore hear me." />
  <aya id="26" text="It was said: Enter the garden. He said: O would that my people had known" />
  <aya id="27" text="Of that on account of which my Lord has forgiven me and made me of the honored ones!" />
  <aya id="28" text="And We did not send down upon his people after him any hosts from heaven, nor do We ever send down." />
  <aya id="29" text="It was naught but a single cry, and lo! they were still." />
  <aya id="30" text="Alas for the servants! there comes not to them an apostle but they mock at him." />
  <aya id="31" text="Do they not consider how many of the generations have We destroyed before them, because they do not turn to them?" />
  <aya id="32" text="And all of them shall surely be brought before Us." />
  <aya id="33" text="And a sign to them is the dead earth: We give life to it and bring forth from it grain so they eat of it." />
  <aya id="34" text="And We make therein gardens of palms and grapevines and We make springs to flow forth in it," />
  <aya id="35" text="That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands did not make it; will they not then be grateful?" />
  <aya id="36" text="Glory be to Him Who created pairs of all things, of what the earth grows, and of their kind and of what they do not know." />
  <aya id="37" text="And a sign to them is the night: We draw forth from it the day, then lo! they are in the dark;" />
  <aya id="38" text="And the sun runs on to a term appointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing." />
  <aya id="39" text="And (as for) the moon, We have ordained for it stages till it becomes again as an old dry palm branch." />
  <aya id="40" text="Neither is it allowable to the sun that it should overtake the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day; and all float on in a sphere." />
  <aya id="41" text="And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship." />
  <aya id="42" text="And We have created for them the like of it, what they will ride on." />
  <aya id="43" text="And if We please, We can drown them, then there shall be no succorer for them, nor shall they be rescued," />
  <aya id="44" text="But (by) mercy from Us and for enjoyment till a time." />
  <aya id="45" text="And when it is said to them: Guard against what is before you and what is behind you, that mercy may be had on you." />
  <aya id="46" text="And there comes not to them a communication of the communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it." />
  <aya id="47" text="And when it is said to them: Spend out of what Allah has given you, those who disbelieve say to those who believe: Shall we feed him whom, if Allah please, He could feed? You are in naught but clear error." />
  <aya id="48" text="And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful?" />
  <aya id="49" text="They wait not for aught but a single cry which will overtake them while they yet contend with one another." />
  <aya id="50" text="So they shall not be able to make a bequest, nor shall they return to their families." />
  <aya id="51" text="And the trumpet shall be blown, when lo! from their graves they shall hasten on to their Lord." />
  <aya id="52" text="They shall say: O woe to us! who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? This is what the Beneficent God promised and the apostles told the truth." />
  <aya id="53" text="There would be naught but a single cry, when lo! they shall all be brought before Us;" />
  <aya id="54" text="So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and you shall not be rewarded aught but that which you did." />
  <aya id="55" text="Surely the dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in an occupation quite happy." />
  <aya id="56" text="They and their wives shall be in shades, reclining on raised couches." />
  <aya id="57" text="They shall have fruits therein, and they shall have whatever they desire." />
  <aya id="58" text="Peace: a word from a Merciful Lord." />
  <aya id="59" text="And get aside today, O guilty ones!" />
  <aya id="60" text="Did I not charge you, O children of Adam! that you should not serve the Shaitan? Surely he is your open enemy," />
  <aya id="61" text="And that you should serve Me; this is the right way." />
  <aya id="62" text="And certainly he led astray numerous people from among you. What! could you not then understand?" />
  <aya id="63" text="This is the hell with which you were threatened." />
  <aya id="64" text="Enter into it this day because you disbelieved." />
  <aya id="65" text="On that day We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned." />
  <aya id="66" text="And if We please We would certainly put out their eyes, then they would run about groping for the way, but how should they see?" />
  <aya id="67" text="And if We please We would surely transform them in their place, then they would not be able to go on, nor will they return." />
  <aya id="68" text="And whomsoever We cause to live long, We reduce (him) to an abject state in constitution; do they not then understand?" />
  <aya id="69" text="And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it meet for him; it is nothing but a reminder and a plain Quran," />
  <aya id="70" text="That it may warn him who would have life, and (that) the word may prove true against the unbelievers." />
  <aya id="71" text="Do they not see that We have created cattle for them, out of what Our hands have wrought, so they are their masters?" />
  <aya id="72" text="And We have subjected them to them, so some of them they have to ride upon, and some of them they eat." />
  <aya id="73" text="And therein they have advantages and drinks; will they not then be grateful?" />
  <aya id="74" text="And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be helped." />
  <aya id="75" text="(But) they shall not be able to assist them, and they shall be a host brought up before them." />
  <aya id="76" text="Therefore let not their speech grieve you; surely We know what they do in secret and what they do openly." />
  <aya id="77" text="Does not man see that We have created him from the small seed? Then lo! he is an open disputant." />
  <aya id="78" text="And he strikes out a likeness for Us and forgets his own creation. Says he: Who will give life to the bones when they are rotten?" />
  <aya id="79" text="Say: He will give life to them Who brought them into existence at first, and He is Cognizant of all creation," />
  <aya id="80" text="He Who has made for you the fire (to burn) from the green tree, so that with it you kindle (fire)." />
  <aya id="81" text="Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Yea! and He is the Creator (of all), the Knower." />
  <aya id="82" text="His command, when He intends anything, is only to say to it: Be, so it is." />
  <aya id="83" text="Therefore glory be to Him in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things, and to Him you shall be brought back." />
