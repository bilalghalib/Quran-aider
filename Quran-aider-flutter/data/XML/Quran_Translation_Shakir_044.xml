  <aya id="2" text="I swear by the Book that makes manifest (the truth)." />
  <aya id="3" text="Surely We revealed it on a blessed night surely We are ever warning —" />
  <aya id="4" text="Therein every wise affair is made distinct," />
  <aya id="5" text="A command from Us; surely We are the senders (of apostles)," />
  <aya id="6" text="A mercy from your Lord, surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing," />
  <aya id="7" text="The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you would be sure." />
  <aya id="8" text="There is no god but He; He gives life and causes death, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore." />
  <aya id="9" text="Nay, they are in doubt, they sport." />
  <aya id="10" text="Therefore keep waiting for the day when the heaven shall bring an evident smoke," />
  <aya id="11" text="That shall overtake men; this is a painful punishment." />
  <aya id="12" text="Our Lord! remove from us the punishment; surely we are believers." />
  <aya id="13" text="How shall they be reminded, and there came to them an Apostle making clear (the truth)," />
  <aya id="14" text="Yet they turned their backs on him and said: One taught (by others), a madman." />
  <aya id="15" text="Surely We will remove the punishment a little, (but) you will surely return (to evil)." />
  <aya id="16" text="On the day when We will seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We will inflict retribution." />
  <aya id="17" text="And certainly We tried before them the people of Firon, and there came to them a noble apostle," />
  <aya id="18" text="Saying: Deliver to me the servants of Allah, surely I am a faithful apostle to you," />
  <aya id="19" text="And that do not exalt yourselves against Allah, surely I will bring to you a clear authority:" />
  <aya id="20" text="And surely I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord that you should stone me to death:" />
  <aya id="21" text="And if you do not believe in me, then leave me alone." />
  <aya id="22" text="Then he called upon his Lord: These are a guilty people." />
  <aya id="23" text="So go forth with My servants by night; surely you will be pursued:" />
  <aya id="24" text="And leave the sea intervening; surely they are a host that shall be drowned." />
  <aya id="25" text="How many of the gardens and fountains have they left!" />
  <aya id="26" text="And cornfields and noble places!" />
  <aya id="27" text="And goodly things wherein they rejoiced;" />
  <aya id="28" text="Thus (it was), and We gave them as a heritage to another people." />
  <aya id="29" text="So the heaven and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they respited." />
  <aya id="30" text="And certainly We delivered the children of Israel from the abasing chastisement," />
  <aya id="31" text="From Firon; surely he was haughty, (and) one of the extravagant." />
  <aya id="32" text="And certainly We chose them, having knowledge, above the nations." />
  <aya id="33" text="And We gave them of the communications wherein was clear blessing." />
  <aya id="34" text="Most surely these do say:" />
  <aya id="35" text="There is naught but our first death and we shall not be raised again." />
  <aya id="36" text="So bring our fathers (back), if you are truthful." />
  <aya id="37" text="Are they better or the people of Tubba and those before them? We destroyed them, for surely they were guilty." />
  <aya id="38" text="And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in sport." />
  <aya id="39" text="We did not create them both but with the truth, but most of them do not know." />
  <aya id="40" text="Surely the day of separation is their appointed term, of all of them;" />
  <aya id="41" text="The day on which a friend shall not avail (his) friend aught, nor shall they be helped," />
  <aya id="42" text="Save those on whom Allah shall have mercy; surely He is the Mighty the Merciful." />
  <aya id="43" text="Surely the tree of the Zaqqum," />
  <aya id="44" text="Is the food of the sinful," />
  <aya id="45" text="Like dregs of oil; it shall boil in (their) bellies," />
  <aya id="46" text="Like the boiling of hot water." />
  <aya id="47" text="Seize him, then drag him down into the middle of the hell;" />
  <aya id="48" text="Then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling water:" />
  <aya id="49" text="Taste; you forsooth are the mighty, the honorable:" />
  <aya id="50" text="Surely this is what you disputed about." />
  <aya id="51" text="Surely those who guard (against evil) are in a secure place," />
  <aya id="52" text="In gardens and springs;" />
  <aya id="53" text="They shall wear of fine and thick silk, (sitting) face to face;" />
  <aya id="54" text="Thus (shall it be), and We will wed them with Houris pure, beautiful ones." />
  <aya id="55" text="They shall call therein for every fruit in security;" />
  <aya id="56" text="They shall not taste therein death except the first death, and He will save them from the punishment of the hell," />
  <aya id="57" text="A grace from your Lord; this is the great achievement." />
  <aya id="58" text="So have We made it easy in your tongue that they may be mindful." />
  <aya id="59" text="Therefore wait; surely they are waiting." />
