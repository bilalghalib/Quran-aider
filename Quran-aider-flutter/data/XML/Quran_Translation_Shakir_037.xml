  <aya id="1" text="I swear by those who draw themselves out in ranks," />
  <aya id="2" text="Then those who drive away with reproof," />
  <aya id="3" text="Then those who recite, being mindful," />
  <aya id="4" text="Most surely your God is One:" />
  <aya id="5" text="The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the easts." />
  <aya id="6" text="Surely We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment, the stars," />
  <aya id="7" text="And (there is) a safeguard against every rebellious Shaitan." />
  <aya id="8" text="They cannot listen to the exalted assembly and they are thrown at from every side," />
  <aya id="9" text="Being driven off, and for them is a perpetual chastisement," />
  <aya id="10" text="Except him who snatches off but once, then there follows him a brightly shining flame." />
  <aya id="11" text="Then ask them whether they are stronger in creation or those (others) whom We have created. Surely We created them of firm clay." />
  <aya id="12" text="Nay! you wonder while they mock," />
  <aya id="13" text="And when they are reminded, they mind not," />
  <aya id="14" text="And when they see a sign they incite one another to scoff," />
  <aya id="15" text="And they say: This is nothing but clear magic:" />
  <aya id="16" text="What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then certainly be raised," />
  <aya id="17" text="Or our fathers of yore?" />
  <aya id="18" text="Say: Aye! and you shall be abject." />
  <aya id="19" text="So it shall only be a single cry, when lo! they shall see." />
  <aya id="20" text="And they shall say: O woe to us! this is the day of requital." />
  <aya id="21" text="This is the day of the judgment which you called a lie." />
  <aya id="22" text="Gather together those who were unjust and their associates, and what they used to worship" />
  <aya id="23" text="Besides Allah, then lead them to the way to hell." />
  <aya id="24" text="And stop them, for they shall be questioned:" />
  <aya id="25" text="What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?" />
  <aya id="26" text="Nay! on that day they shall be submissive." />
  <aya id="27" text="And some of them shall advance towards others, questioning each other." />
  <aya id="28" text="They shall say: Surely you used to come to us from the right side." />
  <aya id="29" text="They shall say: Nay, you (yourselves) were not believers;" />
  <aya id="30" text="And we had no authority over you, but you were an inordinate people;" />
  <aya id="31" text="So the sentence of our Lord has come to pass against us: (now) we shall surely taste;" />
  <aya id="32" text="So we led you astray, for we ourselves were erring." />
  <aya id="33" text="So they shall on that day be sharers in the chastisement one with another." />
  <aya id="34" text="Surely thus do We deal with the guilty." />
  <aya id="35" text="Surely they used to behave proudly when it was said to them: There is no god but Allah;" />
  <aya id="36" text="And to say: What! shall we indeed give up our gods for the sake of a mad poet?" />
  <aya id="37" text="Nay: he has come with the truth and verified the apostles." />
  <aya id="38" text="Most surely you will taste the painful punishment." />
  <aya id="39" text="And you shall not be rewarded except (for) what you did." />
  <aya id="40" text="Save the servants of Allah, the purified ones." />
  <aya id="41" text="For them is a known sustenance," />
  <aya id="42" text="Fruits, and they shall be highly honored," />
  <aya id="43" text="In gardens of pleasure," />
  <aya id="44" text="On thrones, facing each other." />
  <aya id="45" text="A bowl shall be made to go round them from water running out of springs," />
  <aya id="46" text="White, delicious to those who drink." />
  <aya id="47" text="There shall be no trouble in it, nor shall they be exhausted therewith." />
  <aya id="48" text="And with them shall be those who restrain the eyes, having beautiful eyes;" />
  <aya id="49" text="As if they were eggs carefully protected." />
  <aya id="50" text="Then shall some of them advance to others, questioning each other." />
  <aya id="51" text="A speaker from among them shall say: Surely I had a comrade of mine," />
  <aya id="52" text="Who said: What! are you indeed of those who accept (the truth)?" />
  <aya id="53" text="What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then be certainly brought to judgment?" />
  <aya id="54" text="He shall say: Will you look on?" />
  <aya id="55" text="Then he looked down and saw him in the midst of hell." />
  <aya id="56" text="He shall say: By Allah! you had almost caused me to perish;" />
  <aya id="57" text="And had it not been for the favor of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought up." />
  <aya id="58" text="Is it then that we are not going to die," />
  <aya id="59" text="Except our previous death? And we shall not be chastised?" />
  <aya id="60" text="Most surely this is the mighty achievement." />
  <aya id="61" text="For the like of this then let the workers work." />
  <aya id="62" text="Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum?" />
  <aya id="63" text="Surely We have made it to be a trial to the unjust." />
  <aya id="64" text="Surely it is a tree that-grows in the bottom of the hell;" />
  <aya id="65" text="Its produce is as it were the heads of the serpents." />
  <aya id="66" text="Then most surely they shall eat of it and fill (their) bellies with it." />
  <aya id="67" text="Then most surely they shall have after it to drink of a mixture prepared in boiling water." />
  <aya id="68" text="Then most surely their return shall be to hell." />
  <aya id="69" text="Surely they found their fathers going astray," />
  <aya id="70" text="So in their footsteps they are being hastened on." />
  <aya id="71" text="And certainly most of the ancients went astray before them," />
  <aya id="72" text="And certainly We sent among them warners." />
  <aya id="73" text="Then see how was the end of those warned," />
  <aya id="74" text="Except the servants of Allah, the purified ones." />
  <aya id="75" text="And Nuh did certainly call upon Us, and most excellent answerer of prayer are We." />
  <aya id="76" text="And We delivered him and his followers from the mighty distress." />
  <aya id="77" text="And We made his offspring the survivors." />
  <aya id="78" text="And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later generations." />
  <aya id="79" text="Peace and salutation to Nuh among the nations." />
  <aya id="80" text="Thus do We surely reward the doers of good." />
  <aya id="81" text="Surely he was of Our believing servants." />
  <aya id="82" text="Then We drowned the others." />
  <aya id="83" text="And most surely Ibrahim followed his way." />
  <aya id="84" text="When he came to his Lord with a free heart," />
  <aya id="85" text="When he said to his father and his people: What is it that you worship?" />
  <aya id="86" text="A lie — gods besides Allah — do you desire?" />
  <aya id="87" text="What is then your idea about the Lord of the worlds?" />
  <aya id="88" text="Then he looked at the stars, looking up once," />
  <aya id="89" text="Then he said: Surely I am sick (of your worshipping these)." />
  <aya id="90" text="So they went away from him, turning back." />
  <aya id="91" text="Then he turned aside to their gods secretly and said: What! do you not eat?" />
  <aya id="92" text="What is the matter with you that you do not speak?" />
  <aya id="93" text="Then he turned against them secretly, smiting them with the right hand." />
  <aya id="94" text="So they (people) advanced towards him, hastening." />
  <aya id="95" text="Said he: What! do you worship what you hew out?" />
  <aya id="96" text="And Allah has created you and what you make." />
  <aya id="97" text="They said: Build for him a furnace, then cast him into the burning fire." />
  <aya id="98" text="And they desired a war against him, but We brought them low." />
  <aya id="99" text="And he said: Surely I fly to my lord; He will guide me." />
  <aya id="100" text="My Lord! grant me of the doers of good deeds." />
  <aya id="101" text="So We gave him the good news of a boy, possessing forbearance." />
  <aya id="102" text="And when he attained to working with him, he said: O my son! surely I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice you; consider then what you see. He said: O my father! do what you are commanded; if Allah please, you will find me of the patient ones." />
  <aya id="103" text="So when they both submitted and he threw him down upon his forehead," />
  <aya id="104" text="And We called out to him saying: O Ibrahim!" />
  <aya id="105" text="You have indeed shown the truth of the vision; surely thus do We reward the doers of good:" />
  <aya id="106" text="Most surely this is a manifest trial." />
  <aya id="107" text="And We ransomed him with a Feat sacrifice." />
  <aya id="108" text="And We perpetuated (praise) to him among the later generations." />
  <aya id="109" text="Peace be on Ibrahim." />
  <aya id="110" text="Thus do We reward the doers of good." />
  <aya id="111" text="Surely he was one of Our believing servants." />
  <aya id="112" text="And We gave him the good news of Ishaq, a prophet among the good ones." />
  <aya id="113" text="And We showered Our blessings on him and on Ishaq; and of their offspring are the doers of good, and (also) those who are clearly unjust to their own souls." />
  <aya id="114" text="And certainly We conferred a favor on Musa and Haroun." />
  <aya id="115" text="And We delivered them both and their people from the mighty distress." />
  <aya id="116" text="And We helped them, so they were the vanquishers." />
  <aya id="117" text="And We gave them both the Book that made (things) clear." />
  <aya id="118" text="And We guided them both on the right way." />
  <aya id="119" text="And We perpetuated (praise) to them among the later generations." />
  <aya id="120" text="Peace be on Musa and Haroun." />
  <aya id="121" text="Even thus do We reward the doers of good." />
  <aya id="122" text="Surely they were both of Our believing servants." />
  <aya id="123" text="And Ilyas was most surely of the apostles." />
  <aya id="124" text="When he said to his people: Do you not guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="125" text="What! do you call upon Ba'l and forsake the best of the creators," />
  <aya id="126" text="Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore?" />
  <aya id="127" text="But they called him a liar, therefore they shall most surely be brought up." />
  <aya id="128" text="But not the servants of Allah, the purified ones." />
  <aya id="129" text="And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later generations." />
  <aya id="130" text="Peace be on Ilyas." />
  <aya id="131" text="Even thus do We reward the doers of good." />
  <aya id="132" text="Surely he was one of Our believing servants." />
  <aya id="133" text="And Lut was most surely of the apostles." />
  <aya id="134" text="When We delivered him and his followers, all —" />
  <aya id="135" text="Except an old woman (who was) amongst those who tarried." />
  <aya id="136" text="Then We destroyed the others." />
  <aya id="137" text="And most surely you pass by them in the morning," />
  <aya id="138" text="And at night; do you not then understand?" />
  <aya id="139" text="And Yunus was most surely of the apostles." />
  <aya id="140" text="When he ran away to a ship completely laden," />
  <aya id="141" text="So he shared (with them), but was of those who are cast off." />
  <aya id="142" text="So the fish swallowed him while he did that for which he blamed himself." />
  <aya id="143" text="But had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Us)," />
  <aya id="144" text="He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised." />
  <aya id="145" text="Then We cast him on to the vacant surface of the earth while he was sick." />
  <aya id="146" text="And We caused to grow up for him a gourdplant." />
  <aya id="147" text="And We sent him to a hundred thousand, rather they exceeded." />
  <aya id="148" text="And they believed, so We gave them provision till a time." />
  <aya id="149" text="Then ask them whether your Lord has daughters and they have sons." />
  <aya id="150" text="Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses?" />
  <aya id="151" text="Now surely it is of their own lie that they say:" />
  <aya id="152" text="Allah has begotten; and most surely they are liars." />
  <aya id="153" text="Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons?" />
  <aya id="154" text="What is the matter with you, how is it that you judge?" />
  <aya id="155" text="Will you not then mind?" />
  <aya id="156" text="Or have you a clear authority?" />
  <aya id="157" text="Then bring your book, if you are truthful." />
  <aya id="158" text="And they assert a relationship between Him and the jinn; and certainly the jinn do know that they shall surely be brought up;" />
  <aya id="159" text="Glory be to Allah (for freedom) from what they describe;" />
  <aya id="160" text="But not so the servants of Allah, the purified ones." />
  <aya id="161" text="So surely you and what you worship," />
  <aya id="162" text="Not against Him can you cause (any) to fall into trial," />
  <aya id="163" text="Save him who will go to hell." />
  <aya id="164" text="And there is none of us but has an assigned place," />
  <aya id="165" text="And most surely we are they who draw themselves out in ranks," />
  <aya id="166" text="And we are most surely they who declare the glory (of Allah)." />
  <aya id="167" text="And surely they used to say:" />
  <aya id="168" text="Had we a reminder from those of yore," />
  <aya id="169" text="We would certainly have been the servants of Allah — the purified ones." />
  <aya id="170" text="But (now) they disbelieve in it, so they will come to know." />
  <aya id="171" text="And certainly Our word has already gone forth in respect of Our servants, the apostles:" />
  <aya id="172" text="Most surely they shall be the assisted ones," />
  <aya id="173" text="And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones." />
  <aya id="174" text="Therefore turn away from them till a time," />
  <aya id="175" text="And (then) see them, so they too shall see." />
  <aya id="176" text="What! would they then hasten on Our chastisement?" />
  <aya id="177" text="But when it shall descend in their court, evil shall then be the morning of the warned ones." />
  <aya id="178" text="And turn away from them till a time," />
  <aya id="179" text="And (then) see, for they too shall see." />
  <aya id="180" text="Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Honor, above what they describe." />
  <aya id="181" text="And peace be on the apostles." />
  <aya id="182" text="And all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds." />
