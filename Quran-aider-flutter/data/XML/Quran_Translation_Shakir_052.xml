  <aya id="9" text="On the day when the heaven shall move from side to side," />
  <aya id="10" text="And the mountains shall pass away passing away (altogether)." />
  <aya id="11" text="So woe on that day to those who reject (the truth)," />
  <aya id="12" text="Those who sport entering into vain discourses." />
  <aya id="13" text="The day on which they shall be driven away to the fire of hell with violence." />
  <aya id="14" text="This is the fire which you used to give the lie to." />

  <aya id="44" text="And if they should see a portion of the heaven coming down, they would say: Piled up clouds." />
  <aya id="45" text="Leave them then till they meet that day of theirs wherein they shall be made to swoon (with terror):" />
  <aya id="46" text="The day on which their struggle shall not avail them aught, nor shall they be helped." />
  <aya id="47" text="And surely those who are unjust shall have a punishment besides that (in the world), but most of them do not know." />
  <aya id="48" text="And wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord, for surely you are before Our eyes, and sing the praise of your Lord when you rise;" />
