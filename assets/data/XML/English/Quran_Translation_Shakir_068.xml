  <aya id="1" text="Noon. I swear by the pen and what the angels write," />
  <aya id="2" text="By the grace of your Lord you are not mad." />
  <aya id="3" text="And most surely you shall have a reward never to be cut off." />
  <aya id="4" text="And most surely you conform (yourself) to sublime morality." />
  <aya id="5" text="So you shall see, and they (too) shall see," />
  <aya id="6" text="Which of you is afflicted with madness." />
  <aya id="7" text="Surely your Lord best knows him who errs from His way, and He best knows the followers of the right course." />
  <aya id="8" text="So do not yield to the rejecters." />
  <aya id="9" text="They wish that you should be pliant so they (too) would be pliant." />
  <aya id="10" text="And yield not to any mean swearer," />
  <aya id="11" text="Defamer, going about with slander," />
  <aya id="12" text="Forbidder of good, outstepping the limits, sinful," />
  <aya id="13" text="Ignoble, besides all that, base-born;" />
  <aya id="14" text="Because he possesses wealth and sons." />
  <aya id="15" text="When Our communications are recited to him, he says: Stories of those of yore." />
  <aya id="16" text="We will brand him on the nose." />
  <aya id="17" text="Surely We will try them as We tried the owners of the garden, when they swore that they would certainly cut off the produce in the morning," />
  <aya id="18" text="And were not willing to set aside a portion (for the poor)." />
  <aya id="19" text="Then there encompassed it a visitation from your Lord while they were sleeping." />
  <aya id="20" text="So it became as black, barren land." />
  <aya id="21" text="And they called out to each other in the morning," />
  <aya id="22" text="Saying: Go early to your tilth if you would cut (the produce)." />
  <aya id="23" text="So they went, while they consulted together secretly," />
  <aya id="24" text="Saying: No poor man shall enter it today upon you." />
  <aya id="25" text="And in the morning they went, having the power to prevent." />
  <aya id="26" text="But when they saw it, they said: Most surely we have gone astray." />
  <aya id="27" text="Nay! we are made to suffer privation." />
  <aya id="28" text="The best of them said: Did I not say to you, Why do you not glorify (Allah)?" />
  <aya id="29" text="They said: Glory be to our Lord, surely we were unjust." />
  <aya id="30" text="Then some of them advanced against others, blaming each other." />
  <aya id="31" text="Said they: O woe to us! surely we were inordinate:" />
  <aya id="32" text="Maybe, our Lord will give us instead one better than it; surely to our Lord do we make our humble petition." />
  <aya id="33" text="Such is the chastisement, and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is greater, did they but know!" />
  <aya id="34" text="Surely those who guard (against evil) shall have with their Lord gardens of bliss." />
  <aya id="35" text="What! shall We then make (i.e. treat) those who submit as the guilty?" />
  <aya id="36" text="What has happened to you? How do you judge?" />
  <aya id="37" text="Or have you a book wherein you read," />
  <aya id="38" text="That you have surely therein what you choose?" />
  <aya id="39" text="Or have you received from Us an agreement confirmed by an oath extending to the day of resurrection that you shall surely have what you demand?" />
  <aya id="40" text="Ask them which of them will vouch for that," />
  <aya id="41" text="Or have they associates if they are truthful." />
  <aya id="42" text="On the day when there shall be a severe affliction, and they shall be called upon to make obeisance, but they shall not be able," />
  <aya id="43" text="Their looks cast down, abasement shall overtake them; and they were called upon to make obeisance indeed while yet they were safe." />
  <aya id="44" text="So leave Me and him who rejects this announcement; We will overtake them by degrees, from whence they perceive not:" />
  <aya id="45" text="And I do bear with them, surely My plan is firm." />
  <aya id="46" text="Or do you ask from them a reward, so that they are burdened with debt?" />
  <aya id="47" text="Or have they (the knowledge of) the unseen, so that they write (it) down?" />
  <aya id="48" text="So wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord, and be not like the companion of the fish, when he cried while he was in distress." />
  <aya id="49" text="Were it not that favor from his Lord had overtaken him, he would certainly have been cast down upon the naked Found while he was blamed." />
  <aya id="50" text="Then his Lord chose him, and He made him of the good." />
  <aya id="51" text="And those who disbelieve would almost smite you with their eyes when they hear the reminder, and they say: Most surely he is mad." />
  <aya id="52" text="And it is naught but a reminder to the nations." />
