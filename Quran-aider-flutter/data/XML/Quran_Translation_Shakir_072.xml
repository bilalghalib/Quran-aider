  <aya id="1" text="Say: It has been revealed to me that a party of the jinn listened, and they said: Surely we have heard a wonderful Quran," />
  <aya id="2" text="Guiding to the right way, so we believe in it, and we will not set up any one with our Lord:" />
  <aya id="3" text="And that He — exalted be the majesty of our Lord — has not taken a consort, nor a son:" />
  <aya id="4" text="And that the foolish amongst us used to forge extravagant things against Allah:" />
  <aya id="5" text="And that we thought that men and jinn did not utter a lie against Allah:" />
  <aya id="6" text="And that persons from among men used to seek refuge with persons from among jinn, so they increased them in wrongdoing:" />
  <aya id="7" text="And that they thought as you think, that Allah would not raise anyone:" />
  <aya id="8" text="And that we sought to reach heaven, but we found it filled with strong guards and flaming stars." />
  <aya id="9" text="And that we used to sit in some of the sitting-places thereof to steal a hearing, but he who would (try to) listen now would find a flame lying in wait for him:" />
  <aya id="10" text="And that we know not whether evil is meant for those who are on earth or whether their Lord means to bring them good:" />
