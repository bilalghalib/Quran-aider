  <aya id="2" text="What is the sure calamity! And what would make you realize what the sure calamity is!" />
  <aya id="3" text="Samood and Ad called the striking calamity a lie." />
  <aya id="4" text="Then as to Samood, they were destroyed by an excessively severe punishment." />
  <aya id="5" text="And as to Ad, they were destroyed by a roaring, violent blast." />
  <aya id="6" text="Which He made to prevail against them for seven nights and eight days unremittingly, so that you might have seen the people therein prostrate as if they were the trunks of hollow palms." />
  <aya id="7" text="Do you then see of them one remaining?" />
  <aya id="8" text="And Firon and those before him and the overthrown cities continuously committed sins." />
  <aya id="9" text="And they disobeyed the Apostle of their Lord, so He punished them with a vehement punishment." />
  <aya id="10" text="Surely We bore you up in the ship when the water rose high," />
  <aya id="11" text="So that We may make it a reminder to you, and that the retaining ear might retain it." />
  <aya id="12" text="And when the trumpet is blown with a single blast," />
  <aya id="13" text="And the earth and the mountains are borne away and crushed with a single crushing." />
  <aya id="14" text="On that day shall the great event come to pass," />

  <aya id="17" text="On that day you shall be exposed to view — no secret of yours shall remain hidden." />
  <aya id="18" text="Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will say: Lo! read my book:" />
  <aya id="19" text="Surely I knew that I shall meet my account." />
  <aya id="20" text="So he shall be in a life of pleasure," />

  <aya id="22" text="The fruits of which are near at hand:" />
  <aya id="23" text="Eat and drink pleasantly for what you did beforehand in the days gone by." />

  <aya id="27" text="My wealth has availed me nothing:" />
  <aya id="28" text="My authority is gone away from me." />
  <aya id="29" text="Lay hold on him, then put a chain on him," />
  <aya id="30" text="Then cast him into the burning fire," />
  <aya id="31" text="Then thrust him into a chain the length of which is seventy cubits." />
  <aya id="32" text="Surely he did not believe in Allah, the Great," />

  <aya id="43" text="And if he had fabricated against Us some of the sayings," />
  <aya id="44" text="We would certainly have seized him by the right hand," />
  <aya id="45" text="Then We would certainly have cut off his aorta." />
  <aya id="46" text="And not one of you could have withheld Us from him." />
  <aya id="47" text="And most surely it is a reminder for those who guard (against evil)." />
  <aya id="48" text="And most surely We know that some of you are rejecters." />
  <aya id="49" text="And most surely it is a great grief to the unbelievers." />
  <aya id="50" text="And most surely it is the true certainty." />
  <aya id="51" text="Therefore-glorify the name of your Lord, the Great." />
