  <aya id="1" text="Suad, I swear by the Quran, full of admonition." />
  <aya id="2" text="Nay! those who disbelieve are in self-exaltation and opposition." />
  <aya id="3" text="How many did We destroy before them of the generations," />
  <aya id="4" text="And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves, and the disbelievers say: This IS an enchanter, a liar." />
  <aya id="5" text="What! makes he the gods a single God? A strange thing is this, to be sure!" />
  <aya id="6" text="And the chief persons of them break forth, saying: Go and steadily adhere to your gods; this is most surely a thing sought after." />
  <aya id="7" text="We never heard of this in the former faith; this is nothing but a forgery:" />
  <aya id="8" text="Has the reminder been revealed to him from among us? Nay! they are in doubt as to My reminder. Nay! they have not yet tasted My chastisement!" />
  <aya id="9" text="Or is it that they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Mighty, the great Giver?" />
  <aya id="10" text="Or is it that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them? Then let them ascend by any means." />
  <aya id="11" text="A host of deserters of the allies shall be here put to flight." />
  <aya id="12" text="The people of Nuh and Ad, and Firon, the lord of spikes, rejected (apostles) before them." />
  <aya id="13" text="And Samood and the people of Lut and the dwellers of the thicket; these were the parties." />
  <aya id="14" text="There was none of them but called the apostles liars, so just was My retribution." />
  <aya id="15" text="Nor do these await aught but a single cry, there being no delay in it." />
  <aya id="16" text="And they say: O our Lord! hasten on to us our portion before the day of reckoning." />
  <aya id="17" text="Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant Dawood, the possessor of power; surely he was frequent in returning (to Allah)." />
  <aya id="18" text="Surely We made the mountains to sing the glory (of Allah) in unison with him at the evening and the sunrise," />
  <aya id="19" text="And the birds gathered together; all joined in singing with him." />
  <aya id="20" text="And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear judgment." />
  <aya id="21" text="And has there come to you the story of the litigants, when they made an entry into the private chamber by ascending over the walls?" />
  <aya id="22" text="When they entered in upon Dawood and he was frightened at them, they said: Fear not; two litigants, of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other, therefore decide between us with justice, and do not act unjustly, and guide us to the right way." />
  <aya id="23" text="Surely this is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have a single ewe; but he said: Make it over to me, and he has prevailed against me in discourse." />
  <aya id="24" text="He said: Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe (to add) to his own ewes; and most surely most of the partners act wrongfully towards one another, save those who believe and do good, and very few are they; and Dawood was sure that We had tried him, so he sought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and turned time after time (to Him)." />
  <aya id="25" text="Therefore We rectified for him this, and most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort." />
  <aya id="26" text="O Dawood! surely We have made you a ruler in the land; so judge between men with justice and do not follow desire, lest it should lead you astray from the path of Allah; (as for) those who go astray from the path of Allah, they shall surely have a severe punishment because they forgot the day of reckoning." />
  <aya id="27" text="And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them in vain; that is the opinion of those who disbelieve then woe to those who disbelieve on account of the fire." />
  <aya id="28" text="Shall We treat those who believe and do good like the mischief-makers in the earth? Or shall We make those who guard (against evil) like the wicked?" />
  <aya id="29" text="(It is) a Book We have revealed to you abounding in good that they may ponder over its verses, and that those endowed with understanding may be mindful." />
  <aya id="30" text="And We gave to Dawood Sulaiman, most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent in returning (to Allah)." />
  <aya id="31" text="When there were brought to him in the evening (horses) still when standing, swift when running —" />
  <aya id="32" text="Then he said: Surely I preferred the good things to the remembrance of my Lord — until the sun set and time for Asr prayer was over, (he said):" />
  <aya id="33" text="Bring them back to me; so he began to slash (their) legs and necks." />
  <aya id="34" text="And certainly We tried Sulaiman, and We put on his throne a (mere) body, so he turned (to Allah)." />
  <aya id="35" text="He said: My Lord! do Thou forgive me and grant me a kingdom which is not fit for (being inherited by) anyone after me;" />
  <aya id="36" text="Then We made the wind subservient to him; it made his command to run gently wherever he desired," />
  <aya id="37" text="And the shaitans, every builder and diver," />
  <aya id="38" text="And others fettered in chains." />
  <aya id="39" text="This is Our free gift, therefore give freely or withhold, without reckoning." />
  <aya id="40" text="And most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort." />
  <aya id="41" text="And remember Our servant Ayyub, when he called upon his Lord: The Shaitan has afflicted me with toil and torment." />
  <aya id="42" text="Urge with your foot; here is a cool washing-place and a drink." />
  <aya id="43" text="And We gave him his family and the like of them with them, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to those possessed of understanding." />
  <aya id="44" text="And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with It and do not break your oath; surely We found him patient; most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent in returning (to Allah)." />
  <aya id="45" text="And remember Our servants Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub, men of power and insight." />
  <aya id="46" text="Surely We purified them by a pure quality, the keeping in mind of the (final) abode." />
  <aya id="47" text="And most surely they were with Us, of the elect, the best." />
  <aya id="48" text="And remember Ismail and Al-Yasha and Zulkifl; and they were all of the best." />
  <aya id="49" text="This is a reminder; and most surely there is an excellent resort for those who guard (against evil)," />
  <aya id="50" text="The gardens of perpetuity, the doors are opened for them." />
  <aya id="51" text="Reclining therein, calling therein for many fruits and drink." />
  <aya id="52" text="And with them shall be those restraining their eyes, equals in age." />
  <aya id="53" text="This is what you are promised for the day of reckoning." />
  <aya id="54" text="Most surely this is Our sustenance; it shall never come to an end;" />
  <aya id="55" text="This (shall be so); and most surely there is an evil resort for the inordinate ones;" />
  <aya id="56" text="Hell; they shall enter it, so evil is the resting-place." />
  <aya id="57" text="This (shall be so); so let them taste it, boiling and intensely cold (drink)." />
  <aya id="58" text="And other (punishment) of the same kind — of various sorts." />
  <aya id="59" text="This is an army plunging in without consideration along with you; no welcome for them, surely they shall enter fire." />
  <aya id="60" text="They shall say: Nay! you — no welcome to you: you did proffer it to us, so evil is the resting-place." />
  <aya id="61" text="They shall say: Our Lord! whoever prepared it first for us, add Thou to him a double chastisement in the fire." />
  <aya id="62" text="And they shall say: What is the matter with us that we do not see men whom we used to count among the vicious?" />
  <aya id="63" text="Was it that we (only) took them in scorn, or have our eyes (now) turned aside from them?" />
  <aya id="64" text="That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the fire." />
  <aya id="65" text="Say: I am only a warner, and there is no god but Allah, the One, the Subduer (of all):" />
  <aya id="66" text="The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Mighty, the most Forgiving." />
  <aya id="67" text="Say: It is a message of importance," />
  <aya id="68" text="(And) you are turning aside from it:" />
  <aya id="69" text="I had no knowledge of the exalted chiefs when they contended:" />
  <aya id="70" text="Naught is revealed to me save that I am a plain warner." />
  <aya id="71" text="When your Lord said to the angels; Surely I am going to create a mortal from dust:" />
  <aya id="72" text="So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down making obeisance to him." />
  <aya id="73" text="And the angels did obeisance, all of them," />
  <aya id="74" text="But not Iblis: he was proud and he was one of the unbelievers." />
  <aya id="75" text="He said: O Iblis! what prevented you that you should do obeisance to him whom I created with My two hands? Are you proud or are you of the exalted ones?" />
  <aya id="76" text="He said: I am better than he; Thou hast created me of fire, and him Thou didst create of dust." />
  <aya id="77" text="He said: Then get out of it, for surely you are driven away:" />
  <aya id="78" text="And surely My curse is on you to the day of judgment." />
  <aya id="79" text="He said: My Lord! then respite me to the day that they are raised." />
  <aya id="80" text="He said: Surely you are of the respited ones," />
  <aya id="81" text="Till the period of the time made known." />
  <aya id="82" text="He said: Then by Thy Might I will surely make them live an evil life, all," />
  <aya id="83" text="Except Thy servants from among them, the purified ones." />
  <aya id="84" text="He said: The truth then is and the truth do I speak:" />
  <aya id="85" text="That I will most certainly fill hell with you and with those among them who follow you, all." />
  <aya id="86" text="Say: I do not ask you for any reward for it; nor am I of those who affect:" />
  <aya id="87" text="It is nothing but a reminder to the nations;" />
  <aya id="88" text="And most certainly you will come to know about it after a time." />
