  <aya id="1" text="O you who are clothed!" />
  <aya id="2" text="Arise and warn," />
  <aya id="3" text="And your Lord do magnify," />
  <aya id="4" text="And your garments do purify," />
  <aya id="5" text="And uncleanness do shun," />
  <aya id="6" text="And bestow not favors that you may receive again with increase," />
  <aya id="7" text="And for the sake of your Lord, be patient." />
  <aya id="8" text="For when the trumpet is sounded," />
  <aya id="9" text="That, at that time, shall be a difficult day," />
  <aya id="10" text="For the unbelievers, anything but easy." />
  <aya id="11" text="Leave Me and him whom I created alone," />
  <aya id="12" text="And give him vast riches," />
  <aya id="13" text="And sons dwelling in his presence," />
  <aya id="14" text="And I adjusted affairs for him adjustably;" />
  <aya id="15" text="And yet he desires that I should add more!" />
  <aya id="16" text="By no means! surely he offers opposition to Our communications." />
  <aya id="17" text="I will make a distressing punishment overtake him." />
  <aya id="18" text="Surely he reflected and guessed," />
  <aya id="19" text="But may he be cursed how he plotted;" />
  <aya id="20" text="Again, may he be cursed how he plotted;" />
  <aya id="21" text="Then he looked," />
  <aya id="22" text="Then he frowned and scowled," />
  <aya id="23" text="Then he turned back and was big with pride," />
  <aya id="24" text="Then he said: This is naught but enchantment, narrated (from others);" />
  <aya id="25" text="This is naught but the word of a mortal." />
  <aya id="26" text="I will cast him into hell." />
  <aya id="27" text="And what will make you realize what hell is?" />
  <aya id="28" text="It leaves naught nor does it spare aught." />
  <aya id="29" text="It scorches the mortal." />
  <aya id="30" text="Over it are nineteen." />
  <aya id="31" text="And We have not made the wardens of the fire others than angels, and We have not made their number but as a trial for those who disbelieve, that those who have been given the book may be certain and those who believe may increase in faith, and those who have been given the book and the believers may not doubt, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the unbelievers may say: What does Allah mean by this parable? Thus does Allah make err whom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases, and none knows the hosts of your Lord but He Himself; and this is naught but a reminder to the mortals." />
  <aya id="32" text="Nay; I swear by the moon," />
  <aya id="33" text="And the night when it departs," />
  <aya id="34" text="And the daybreak when it shines;" />
  <aya id="35" text="Surely it (hell) is one of the gravest (misfortunes)," />
  <aya id="36" text="A warning to mortals," />
  <aya id="37" text="To him among you who wishes to go forward or remain behind." />
  <aya id="38" text="Every soul is held in pledge for what it earns," />
  <aya id="39" text="Except the people of the right hand," />
  <aya id="40" text="In gardens, they shall ask each other" />
  <aya id="41" text="About the guilty:" />
  <aya id="42" text="What has brought you into hell?" />
  <aya id="43" text="They shall say: We were not of those who prayed;" />
  <aya id="44" text="And we used not to feed the poor;" />
  <aya id="45" text="And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who entered into vain discourses." />
  <aya id="46" text="And we used to call the day of judgment a lie;" />
  <aya id="47" text="Till death overtook us." />
  <aya id="48" text="So the intercession of intercessors shall not avail them." />
  <aya id="49" text="What is then the matter with them, that they turn away from the admonition," />
  <aya id="50" text="As if they were asses taking fright" />
  <aya id="51" text="That had fled from a lion?" />
  <aya id="52" text="Nay; every one of them desires that he may be given pages spread out;" />
  <aya id="53" text="Nay! but they do not fear the hereafter." />
  <aya id="54" text="Nay! it is surely an admonition." />
  <aya id="55" text="So whoever pleases may mind it." />
  <aya id="56" text="And they will not mind unless Allah please. He is worthy to be feared and worthy to forgive." />
