  <aya id="1" text="Successful indeed are the believers," />
  <aya id="2" text="Who are humble in their prayers," />
  <aya id="3" text="And who keep aloof from what is vain," />
  <aya id="4" text="And who are givers of poor-rate," />
  <aya id="5" text="And who guard their private parts," />
  <aya id="6" text="Except before their mates or those whom their right hands possess, for they surely are not blameable," />
  <aya id="7" text="But whoever seeks to go beyond that, these are they that exceed the limits;" />
  <aya id="8" text="And those who are keepers of their trusts and their covenant," />
  <aya id="9" text="And those who keep a guard on their prayers;" />
  <aya id="10" text="These are they who are the heirs," />
  <aya id="11" text="Who shall inherit the Paradise; they shall abide therein." />
  <aya id="12" text="And certainly We created man of an extract of clay," />
  <aya id="13" text="Then We made him a small seed in a firm resting-place," />
  <aya id="14" text="Then We made the seed a clot, then We made the clot a lump of flesh, then We made (in) the lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, then We caused it to grow into another creation, so blessed be Allah, the best of the creators." />
  <aya id="15" text="Then after that you will most surely die." />
  <aya id="16" text="Then surely on the day of resurrection you shall be raised." />
  <aya id="17" text="And certainly We made above you seven heavens; and never are We heedless of creation." />
  <aya id="18" text="And We send down water from the cloud according to a measure, then We cause it to settle in the earth, and most surely We are able to carry it away." />
  <aya id="19" text="Then We cause to grow thereby gardens of palm trees and grapes for you; you have in them many fruits and from them do you eat;" />
  <aya id="20" text="And a tree that grows out of Mount Sinai which produces oil and a condiment for those who eat." />
  <aya id="21" text="And most surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle: We make you to drink of what is in their bellies, and you have in them many advantages and of them you eat," />
  <aya id="22" text="And on them and on the ships you are borne." />
  <aya id="23" text="And certainly We sent Nuh to his people, and he said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; will you not then guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="24" text="And the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said: He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves who desires that he may have superiority over you, and if Allah had pleased, He could certainly have sent down angels. We have not heard of this among our fathers of yore:" />
  <aya id="25" text="He is only a madman, so bear with him for a time." />
  <aya id="26" text="He said: O my Lord! help me against their calling me a liar." />
  <aya id="27" text="So We revealed to him, saying: Make the ark before Our eyes and (according to) Our revelation; and when Our command is given and the valley overflows, take into it of every kind a pair, two, and your followers, except those among them against whom the word has gone forth, and do not speak to Me in respect of those who are unjust; surely they shall be drowned." />
  <aya id="28" text="And when you are firmly seated, you and those with you, in the ark, say: All praise is due to Allah who delivered us from the unjust people:" />
  <aya id="29" text="And say: O my Lord! cause me to disembark a blessed alighting, and Thou art the best to cause to alight." />
  <aya id="30" text="Most surely there are signs in this, and most surely We are ever trying (men)." />
  <aya id="31" text="Then We raised up after them another generation." />
  <aya id="32" text="So We sent among them an apostle from among them, saying: Serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; will you not then guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="33" text="And the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and called the meeting of the hereafter a lie, and whom We had given plenty to enjoy in this world's life, said: This is nothing but a mortal like yourselves, eating of what you eat from and drinking of what you drink." />
  <aya id="34" text="And if you obey a mortal like yourselves, then most surely you will be losers:" />
  <aya id="35" text="What! does he threaten you that when you are dead and become dust and bones that you shall then be brought forth?" />
  <aya id="36" text="Far, far is that which you are threatened with." />
  <aya id="37" text="There is naught but our life in this world; we die and we live and we shall not be raised again." />
  <aya id="38" text="He is naught but a man who has forged a lie against Allah, and we are not going to believe in him." />
  <aya id="39" text="He said: O my Lord! help me against their calling me a liar." />
  <aya id="40" text="He said: In a little while they will most certainly be repenting." />
  <aya id="41" text="So the punishment overtook them in justice, and We made them as rubbish; so away with the unjust people." />
  <aya id="42" text="Then We raised after them other generations." />
  <aya id="43" text="No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone (it)." />
  <aya id="44" text="Then We sent Our apostles one after another; whenever there came to a people their apostle, they called him a liar, so We made some of them follow others and We made them stories; so away with a people who do not believe!" />
  <aya id="45" text="Then We sent Musa and his brother Haroun, with Our communications and a clear authority," />
  <aya id="46" text="To Firon and his chiefs, but they behaved haughtily and they were an insolent people." />
  <aya id="47" text="And they said: What! shall we believe in two mortals like ourselves while their people serve us?" />
  <aya id="48" text="So they rejected them and became of those who were destroyed." />
  <aya id="49" text="And certainly We gave Musa the Book that they may follow a right direction." />
  <aya id="50" text="And We made the son of Marium and his mother a sign, and We gave them a shelter on a lofty ground having meadows and springs." />
  <aya id="51" text="O apostles! eat of the good things and do good; surely I know what you do." />
  <aya id="52" text="And surely this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, therefore be careful (of your duty) to Me." />
  <aya id="53" text="But they cut off their religion among themselves into sects, each part rejoicing in that which is with them." />
  <aya id="54" text="Therefore leave them in their overwhelming ignorance till a time." />
  <aya id="55" text="Do they think that by what We aid them with of wealth and children," />
  <aya id="56" text="We are hastening to them of good things? Nay, they do not perceive." />
  <aya id="57" text="Surely they who from fear of their Lord are cautious," />
  <aya id="58" text="And those who believe in the communications of their Lord," />
  <aya id="59" text="And those who do not associate (aught) with their Lord," />
  <aya id="60" text="And those who give what they give (in alms) while their hearts are full of fear that to their Lord they must return," />
  <aya id="61" text="These hasten to good things and they are foremost in (attaining) them." />
  <aya id="62" text="And We do not lay on any soul a burden except to the extent of its ability, and with Us is a book which speaks the truth, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly." />
  <aya id="63" text="Nay, their hearts are in overwhelming ignorance with respect to it and they have besides this other deeds which they do." />
  <aya id="64" text="Until when We overtake those who lead easy lives among them with punishment, lo! they cry for succor." />
  <aya id="65" text="Cry not for succor this day; surely you shall not be given help from Us." />
  <aya id="66" text="My communications were indeed recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels," />
  <aya id="67" text="In arrogance; talking nonsense about the Quran, and left him like one telling fables by night." />
  <aya id="68" text="Is it then that they do not ponder over what is said, or is it that there has come to them that which did not come to their fathers of old?" />
  <aya id="69" text="Or is it that they have not recognized their Apostle, so that they deny him?" />
  <aya id="70" text="Or do they say: There is madness in him? Nay! he has brought them the truth, and most of them are averse from the truth." />
  <aya id="71" text="And should the truth follow their low desires, surely the heavens and the earth and all those who are therein would have perished. Nay! We have brought to them their reminder, but from their reminder they turn aside." />
  <aya id="72" text="Or is it that you ask them a recompense? But the recompense of your Lord is best, and He is the best of those who provide sustenance." />
  <aya id="73" text="And most surely you invite them to a right way." />
  <aya id="74" text="And most surely those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the way." />
  <aya id="75" text="And if We show mercy to them and remove the distress they have, they would persist in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on." />
  <aya id="76" text="And already We overtook them with chastisement, but they were not submissive to their Lord, nor do they humble themselves." />
  <aya id="77" text="Until when We open upon them a door of severe chastisement, lo! they are in despair at it." />
  <aya id="78" text="And He it is Who made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts; little is it that you give thanks." />
  <aya id="79" text="And He it is Who multiplied you in the earth, and to Him you shall be gathered." />
  <aya id="80" text="And He it is Who gives life and causes death, and (in) His (control) is the alternation of the night and the day; do you not then understand?" />
  <aya id="81" text="Nay, they say the like of what the ancients said:" />
  <aya id="82" text="They say: What! When we are dead and become dust and bones, shall we then be raised?" />
  <aya id="83" text="Certainly we are promised this, and (so were) our fathers aforetime; this is naught but stories of those of old." />
  <aya id="84" text="Say: Whose is the earth, and whoever is therein, if you know?" />
  <aya id="85" text="They will say: Allah's. Say: Will you not then mind?" />
  <aya id="86" text="Say: Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the mighty dominion?" />
  <aya id="87" text="They will say: (This is) Allah's. Say: Will you not then guard (against evil)?" />
  <aya id="88" text="Say: Who is it in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things and Who gives succor, but against Him Succor is not given, if you do but know?" />
  <aya id="89" text="They will say: (This is) Allah's. Say: From whence are you then deceived?" />
  <aya id="90" text="Nay! We have brought to them the truth, and most surely they are liars." />
  <aya id="91" text="Never did Allah take to Himself a son, and never was there with him any (other) god — in that case would each god have certainly taken away what he created, and some of them would certainly have overpowered others; glory be to Allah above what they describe!" />
  <aya id="92" text="The Knower of the unseen and the seen, so may He be exalted above what they associate (with Him)." />
  <aya id="93" text="Say: O my Lord! if Thou shouldst make me see what they are threatened with:" />
  <aya id="94" text="My Lord! then place me not with the unjust." />
  <aya id="95" text="And most surely We are well able to make you see what We threaten them with." />
  <aya id="96" text="Repel evil by what is best; We know best what they describe." />
  <aya id="97" text="And say: O my Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from the evil suggestions of the Shaitans;" />
  <aya id="98" text="And I seek refuge in Thee! O my Lord! from their presence." />
  <aya id="99" text="Until when death overtakes one of them, he says: Send me back, my Lord, send me back;" />
  <aya id="100" text="Haply I may do good in that which I have left. By no means! it is a (mere) word that he speaks; and before them is a barrier until the day they are raised." />
  <aya id="101" text="So when the trumpet is blown, there shall be no ties of relationship between them on that day, nor shall they ask of each other." />
  <aya id="102" text="Then as for him whose good deeds are preponderant, these are the successful." />
  <aya id="103" text="And as for him whose good deeds are light, these are they who shall have lost their souls, abiding in hell." />
  <aya id="104" text="The fire shall scorch their faces, and they therein shall be in severe affliction." />
  <aya id="105" text="Were not My communications recited to you? But you used to reject them." />
  <aya id="106" text="They shall say: O our Lord! our adversity overcame us and we were an erring people:" />
  <aya id="107" text="O our Lord! Take us out of it; then if we return (to evil) surely we shall be unjust." />
  <aya id="108" text="He shall say: Go away into it and speak not to Me;" />
  <aya id="109" text="Surely there was a party of My servants who said: O our Lord! we believe, so do Thou forgive us and have mercy on us, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones." />
  <aya id="110" text="But you took them for a mockery until they made you forget My remembrance and you used to laugh at them." />
  <aya id="111" text="Surely I have rewarded them this day because they were patient, that they are the achievers." />
  <aya id="112" text="He will say: How many years did you tarry in the earth?" />
  <aya id="113" text="They will say: We tarried a day or part of a day, but ask those who keep account." />
  <aya id="114" text="He will say: You did tarry but a little — had you but known (it):" />
  <aya id="115" text="What! did you then think that We had created you in vain and that you shall not be returned to Us?" />
  <aya id="116" text="So exalted be Allah, the True King; no god is there but He, the Lord of the honorable dominion." />
  <aya id="117" text="And whoever invokes with Allah another god — he has no proof of this — his reckoning is only with his Lord; surely the unbelievers shall not be successful." />
  <aya id="118" text="And say: O my Lord! forgive and have mercy, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones." />
